# Human-Activity-Recognition-with-Four-Accelerometers
Wearable accelerometers have become integral in health research, offering precise, continuous measurements of physical activity (PA). Our primary objective is to leverage accelerometry data to enhance activity recognition. Prediction of activity by using developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and combination of CNN and GRU units.
